# This configuration should be placed as a hidden file in /root: /root/.dsrc

[rh423]
uri = ldapi://%%2fvar%%2frun%%2fslapd-rh423.socket
basedn = dc=lab,dc=example,dc=com
binddn = cn=Directory Manager

# The above is for use locally on a RHDS system. 
# Note that in the uri for ldapi, the  '/' is replaced to '%%2f' 
# If used with a different instance name, be sure to update that in the uri.

# with ldapi, the uid/gid of 0/0 is mapped to cn=Directory Manager 
# This means that no password is required.

# For use remotely, change the ldapi to ldap or ldaps and add a tls_cacertdir parameter.
